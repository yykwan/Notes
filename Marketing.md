## By IE Business School
Understanding Integrated Marketing Communications  
* IMC is defined as the coordination of all marketing communication tools to maximize impact on consumers while minimizing costs.  
* It extends beyond advertising to include public relations, event promotions, digital marketing, and more.  
Planning Effective IMC Campaigns  
* The course covers the planning process for IMC campaigns, addressing potential challenges and strategies to overcome them.  
* It emphasizes the importance of aligning marketing communications with company characteristics, goals, and consumer needs.  
Theoretical Approaches and Tools  
* The course explores theoretical approaches to advertisement design, including message strategies and advertising appeals.  
* It also discusses the latest trends and tools in marketing communications, such as social media marketing and crisis management.  
Recent Trends in the Market  
Changing Consumer Dynamics  
* Traditional communication was one-way, with brands delivering messages through established media.  
* The digital revolution has empowered consumers, making them active participants who seek experiences and emotional connections with brands.  
Transmedia Storytelling  
* Brands now use transmedia storytelling to engage consumers across multiple platforms, creating a fluid narrative.  
* An example is the marketing strategy for the Star Wars movie, which utilized various media to build anticipation and community engagement.  
Design Thinking and Innovation  
* Design thinking focuses on understanding consumer behavior to drive innovation, moving beyond traditional market research.  
* This approach emphasizes prototyping and refining ideas based on real-world testing to enhance user experience and e-commerce.  
Understanding the Marketing Process  
* The marketing process begins with a thorough analysis of the market situation, including consumers, competitors, collaborators, and the context (the five C's).  
* Key questions must be addressed to understand the company, its target audience, and the competitive landscape.  
Creating Value  
* After understanding the market, the next step is to create distinct value for the target audience through segmentation and targeting.  
* Segmentation involves dividing the market into groups based on shared characteristics, which helps refine marketing efforts and improve efficiency.  
Delivering Value  
* The final step is to construct a marketing program that effectively links strategy to execution, ensuring that the value created is communicated through the marketing mix (product, price, place, promotion).  
* A well-coordinated marketing program fosters strong customer relationships and maximizes sales, leading to the capture of value from consumers.  
Decisions Required for an Effective Communications Campaign  
Understanding Core Business  
* Companies must clearly define their core business to guide marketing and communication strategies.  
* The concept of Marketing Myopia emphasizes the need for a broader perspective that prioritizes consumer needs over a narrow product focus.  
Identifying Competitors  
* Defining competitors is essential; direct competitors offer similar products, while indirect competitors fulfill the same customer needs with different offerings.  
* A clear understanding of competitors helps in differentiating a company's offerings and identifying market opportunities.  
Setting Business and Marketing Goals  
* Companies should establish clear business goals, such as increasing profits or sales, to guide marketing decisions.  
* Consistency in decision-making aligned with these goals is crucial for effective marketing campaigns, whether focusing on customer acquisition or retention.  
Building Customer Based Brand Equity  
Understanding Products and Brands  
* A product is viewed as a bundle of benefits, which can be delivered through physical goods or services.  
* Brand parity occurs when consumers perceive products from different brands as similar, highlighting the need for differentiation.  
Building Customer-Based Brand Equity  
* The customer-based brand equity model by Kevin Lane Keller emphasizes shaping customer perceptions and experiences.  
* The first step is brand identity and awareness, which involves creating brand salience through depth (recall) and breadth (recognition in various situations).  
Steps to Establish Brand Relationships  
* The second step involves defining brand meaning through performance (how well the product meets needs) and imagery (the brand's social and psychological associations).  
* The third step focuses on customer responses, which include judgments about quality and feelings associated with the brand, leading to brand resonance characterized by strong customer relationships.  
Brand Loyalty  
Understanding Brand Loyalty  
* Brand loyalty refers to the extent to which consumers consistently choose the same brand within a product category, which positively impacts sales and reduces marketing costs for companies.  
* Loyal consumers are often willing to pay more and are more forgiving of negative experiences with the brand.  
Types of Brand Loyalty  
* Kristin Northelm identifies three types of brand loyalty: head loyalty (rational involvement), heart loyalty (emotional involvement), and hand loyalty (habitual involvement).  
* Head loyalty is based on specific reasons for purchase decisions, while heart loyalty is tied to personal identity and emotional connections. Hand loyalty is characterized by routine and low involvement.  
Challenges in Managing Brand Loyalty  
* Different types of loyalty require distinct marketing strategies, and shifts between loyalty types can be difficult to detect.  
* Brands must continuously assess consumer loyalty and adapt their marketing efforts to maintain and enhance loyalty across different consumer segments.  
How to Run a Successful Marketing Communications Campaign?  
Understanding Human Behavior  
* Marketing communications is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of human behavior and perceptions.  
* Knowing how people think and make decisions is crucial for effectively communicating brand messages.  
Brand Value Mechanisms  
* It's important to understand the mechanisms that give a brand value in the minds of consumers.  
* This involves recognizing how to create and maintain brand perceptions that resonate with the target audience.  
Strategic Communication Process  
* The communication process begins with identifying the business problem that needs solving.  
* A strong strategy, clear messaging, planning, execution, and evaluation are key steps in delivering effective marketing communications.  
How to Choose a Marketing Communications Agency?  
Choosing an Advertising Agency  
* Talent: The most crucial factor is the talent of the agency's team, as they are responsible for generating creative ideas that address business challenges.  
* Dimension and Structure: Consider the size and model of the agency, as different businesses (small vs. multinational) have varying needs for service delivery.  
Ensuring a Fruitful Relationship  
* Quality of Service: It's essential that the agency not only has good ideas but also the capability to execute and deliver those ideas effectively.  
* Adaptation to Needs: The choice of agency should align with the specific needs of the business, whether that means selecting a large agency with extensive resources or a smaller, specialized agency.  
Structure of an Advertising Agency  
Historical Context of Advertising Agencies  
* Advertising agencies emerged when newspapers began publishing ads, leading artists to create independent companies.  
* Initially, ads were simple, but they evolved into complex communications to serve clients better.  
Structure of Advertising Agencies  
* Modern agencies typically have three main departments: account, creative, and traffic.  
* The account department manages client relationships, while the creative department develops communication pieces, and the traffic department ensures timely project execution.  
Challenges and Future of Advertising Agencies  
* Economic downturns have led to reduced fees for agencies, prompting a shift from traditional structures to collaborations with freelancers and consultants.  
* Despite uncertainties about their future, there remains optimism about the ongoing need for advertising agencies to provide creative talent and communication strategies.  
What are the Main Skills Required to Work in an Advertising Agency?  
Open-Mindedness and Service Orientation  
* Being open-minded is crucial due to the unpredictable nature of the advertising business.  
* A strong service orientation is necessary, requiring positivity and a constructive attitude towards clients.  
Initiative and Teamwork  
* Taking initiative and anticipating client needs is vital for success.  
* Effective teamwork is important, both internally within the agency and externally with clients and stakeholders.  
Interpersonal Skills and Passion  
* Building good relationships and being personable are valuable assets in the industry.  
* A genuine passion for advertising is essential, as the work can be time-consuming and demanding.  
Talent and Creative Thinking  
* While some talent is inherent, continuous improvement and learning are key to enhancing one's skills.  
* Creative thinking and finding innovative solutions are necessary to meet client demands.  
Business Knowledge and Leadership  
* A solid understanding of the client's business is important for effective communication and strategy.  
* Leadership qualities, such as the ability to inspire and persuade clients, contribute to success in the advertising field.  
Consumer Information Processing  
Understanding Consumer Information Processing  
* It's crucial to comprehend how consumers process information to ensure marketing messages are effectively communicated and retained.  
* In today's cluttered advertising environment, brands must create simple, impactful messages that resonate with consumers.  
Selective Processes Theory  
* The theory outlines four steps: selective exposure, selective attention, selective comprehension, and selective retention, explaining how individuals interact with messages.  
* Consumers tend to focus on messages that align with their beliefs, often ignoring or misinterpreting those that do not.  
Importance of Message Alignment  
* For successful advertising, messages must reach consumers, capture their attention, be understood, and be remembered at the point of purchase.  
* Brands should tailor their messages to align with the beliefs and attitudes of their target audience to enhance retention and effectiveness.  
Steps of Effective Communications  
Target Audience Definition  
* Identifying the target audience is crucial, as it influences the communication strategy, including what to say, how to say it, when, and where.  
* The objectives of communication may include establishing brand awareness, disseminating information, or changing attitudes and behaviors.  
Message Strategy and Creative Approach  
* The message strategy involves deciding on the content and appeals that align with brand positioning, emphasizing rational, hedonic, or social benefits.  
* Creative strategies translate messages into specific communications, and the choice of message source (e.g., celebrities) can enhance retention and recall.  
Communication Channels and Measurement  
* Selecting the right communication channels is essential, with options including personal (direct communication) and non-personal (mass media) channels.  
* Measuring the effectiveness of communications involves assessing impact on the target audience, recognition of the message, and overall campaign success to refine future strategies.  
Communications Objectives  
Types of Marketing Communications Objectives  
* Create Awareness: The goal is to make the brand known and memorable, targeting either basic awareness for new brands or top-of-mind awareness for existing brands.  
* Disseminate Information: This involves communicating a clear message about the product, enhancing its perceived importance, as seen in Walmart's "always low prices" campaign.  
Changing Attitudes and Behavior  
* Change Attitudes: Campaigns aim to create an emotional connection with consumers, shifting focus from product features to the consumer's values, as demonstrated by Volvo's safety messaging.  
* Change Behavior: These campaigns include a call to action, encouraging consumers to engage with the brand, such as visiting a website or making a purchase.  
Five Ways to Build Brand Recognition  
Branding Tactics  
* Focus on creating a unique value proposition that differentiates your brand from competitors.  
* Utilize storytelling to connect emotionally with your audience and enhance brand loyalty.  
Market Understanding  
* Conduct thorough market research to identify target audiences and their preferences.  
* Monitor competitors to understand their strategies and find gaps in the market.  
Consistent Messaging  
* Ensure that all marketing communications reflect a consistent brand message across various channels.  
* Adapt your messaging to resonate with different segments of your audience while maintaining core brand values.  
Consumer Decision Making Process  
Need Recognition  
* The process begins with need recognition, where consumers identify a gap between their current situation and their desired situation, triggering the buying decision.  
* Needs can arise from physical requirements or dissatisfaction with existing products, prompting consumers to seek alternatives.  
Information Seeking  
* After recognizing a need, consumers search for information, which can be internal (based on past experiences) or external (from friends, reviews, or advertisements).  
* The awareness set includes brands consumers know, while the consideration set narrows down options that meet their criteria, leading to a choice set for final selection.  
Purchase Decision  
* The purchase step involves various decisions, such as where to buy, how many to purchase, and payment methods, influenced by factors like promotions and shopping experiences.  
* Marketers must anticipate barriers to purchase and address potential influencers, such as family and friends, who may affect the final decision.  
Post-Purchase Evaluation  
* After the purchase, consumers evaluate their choice, leading to satisfaction or disappointment, which impacts future buying behavior.  
* Satisfied consumers are likely to repurchase and share positive feedback, while dissatisfied consumers may return products or voice complaints.  
How Advertising Works – AIDA and Hierarchy of Effects Models  
AIDA Model  
* The AIDA model outlines four stages consumers go through: Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action.  
* Advertisements must first grab attention using visuals and engaging content, then create interest and desire, ultimately leading to a purchase.  
Hierarchy of Effects Model  
* This model expands on AIDA, detailing a step-by-step process: Awareness, Knowledge, Liking, Preference, Conviction, and Behavior.  
* It emphasizes the need to tailor advertisements to the consumer's current stage, using cognitive, affective, or conative approaches.  
Consumer Involvement and Decision-Making  
* Consumer decisions vary in involvement; some purchases require detailed information, while others are made with minimal thought.  
* The sequence of consumer responses can differ based on individual preferences for cognition or emotion, affecting how advertisements should be designed.  
Consumer Approach to the Buying Process: FCB Grid  
FCB Grid Overview  
* The grid consists of four quadrants based on two dimensions: high vs. low involvement and thinking vs. feeling.  
* Each quadrant represents different advertising strategies: informative, affective, habit-forming, and self-satisfaction.  
Quadrant 1: High Involvement, Thinking  
* Products are expensive and important, requiring extensive information before purchase (e.g., cars, houses).  
* Consumers follow a learn, feel, do sequence, with ads focusing on detailed information.  
Quadrant 2: High Involvement, Feeling  
* Products evoke emotional decisions (e.g., designer clothes, engagement rings).  
* The process is feel, learn, do, with ads emphasizing emotional impact and imagery.  
Quadrant 3: Low Involvement, Thinking  
* Everyday items (e.g., detergents) require rational decisions but are low involvement.  
* Consumers typically follow a do, learn, feel pattern, with ads aimed at reminders and brand loyalty.
Quadrant 4: Low Involvement, Feeling  
* Products provide self-satisfaction and are often impulse buys (e.g., snacks, soft drinks).  
* The sequence is do, feel, learn, with ads focusing on lifestyle imagery and quick satisfaction.  
Determining Marketing Communications Budget  
Budgeting Methods  
* Percentage of Sales: Sets the budget as a percentage of current or forecasted sales. While simple, it can lead to reduced budgets during downturns, potentially harming sales.  
* Meet the Competition: Budgets are aligned with competitors' spending. This method assumes that spending at least as much as competitors is necessary to remain competitive, but efficiency in spending is also vital.  
Budgeting Considerations  
* What We Can Afford: Budgets are set after all other expenses, often undervaluing marketing communications. This can lead to insufficient investment if management does not recognize its importance.  
* Objective and Task: This method involves setting a budget based on the costs needed to achieve specific communication objectives, making it a more rational approach.  
Scheduling Methods  
* Continuity: Used for non-seasonal products, maintaining steady advertising.  
* Flighting: Involves intermittent advertising, focusing on peak selling periods.  
* Pulsing: Combines both methods, maintaining a low level of advertising year-round with heavier spending during peak times.  
Relationship Between Communications Budget & Sales  
Understanding the Relationship  
* Sales performance is affected by multiple factors, including economic conditions, competition, and marketing mix variables (e.g., price, product quality).  
* Marketing communications is just one determinant of sales revenue, and its impact varies based on campaign objectives.  
Threshold Effects and Consumer Response  
* Consumers typically need multiple exposures to a marketing message before developing awareness and purchase intentions.  
* A threshold point exists where additional marketing communications begin to positively influence consumer behavior, leading to an optimal return on investment.  
Diminishing Returns and Carry-Over Effects  
* After reaching a saturation point, further advertising may yield diminishing returns, where additional spending has minimal impact on sales.  
* Carry-over effects indicate that effective advertisements can influence future purchasing decisions, but over time, brand recall may fade, necessitating reminders to consumers.  
How to Convince Senior Executives on the Marketing Communications Budget?  
Understanding the Importance of Communication Budgets  
* Marketing communications must demonstrate the long-term value of campaigns, advertising, and plans to senior management.  
* The return on investment (ROI) is often not immediate, making it essential to connect communication efforts to brand value and customer relationships.  
Establishing Clear Objectives  
* It's crucial to define specific objectives for each campaign, such as increasing customer numbers, frequency of purchases, or profit margins.  
* Avoid confusing intermediate metrics (like GRPs or clicks) with actual business goals; the focus should be on sales growth.  
Connecting Actions to Business Outcomes  
* Every marketing action should be linked to a business problem or goal, demonstrating how it contributes to sales and overall business success.  
* Utilize available methods to show the impact of marketing communications on business performance effectively.
